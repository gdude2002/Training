Training
========

Yeah, I just created this repo so I had somewhere to put my project files.

If you're in my course group and you're struggling to follow the exercises
that are being put on the board, you can refer here for alternate solutions.

If you have GitHub, feel free to create issues and comments, or fork this repo
and create pull requests to suggest better solutions to the exercises.
